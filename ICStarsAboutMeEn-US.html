        My name is Iv치n G칩mez, I was born in the city of Racine, Wisconsin, to a Mexican mother from
        the city of Le칩n, Guanajuato, and a Chicano (Mexican slang for "Mexican-American") father.
        I have an older brother and two younger sisters, who are more like nieces to me at this point in life, due to
        the age gap of 8 and 15 years. When it was just my brother and I, our family quickly moved down to
        Kenosha and constantly kept moving throughout my younger years. My parent's complicated
        relationship, on top of being "unique" in every environment I was in, took a toll on my social
        interaction, mental health, and self-esteem. Regardless, I had my own ways to get through these
        times, but the most significant thing that got me through it were my best friends, Casey and Cody Cox,
        and my life-long love for my (mainly nerdy) passions, most of which are still a part of my life to this
        day. I got introduced to media and electronics at a fairly young age; my dad constantly bought movies for
        the family, showed me comic books, and always had tech around the house, regardless of it being obsolete or
        current. My mom and her family constantly bought and played music around me. I constantly surrounded
        myself with these things to pass the time growing up, and they showed me indirectly that I was very curious,
        creative, and eager to learn, even though I wasn't motivated by school. I loved to find out every detail
        about everything I was interested in, whether it was small details of Spider-Man, an obscure
        Nintendo game, making crafts that the average person wouldn't think of, listening to rough cuts from Linkin
        Park,
        or being able to learn software very easily.

      For my sake, the latter was something I knew could make up for my poor grades, so I always
      knew I wanted it to be my future career since software feels like a third language to me. However,
      I could never settle on anything. I initially wanted to be a Computer Engineer, then I wanted to be an IT
      support specialist, and lastly, it turned into Graphic Design. There was a point where I felt stuck and
      didn't think advancing would work since neither my parents nor I had financial stability to have me go to
      college, and my lack in school smarts and social skills would negatively affect me. But I didn't want to
      stay in retail, customer service, or surround myself in toxic warehouse environments to make decent money,
      while paying for it physically and mentally. However, I remember brushing off I.C. Stars when
      my aunt suggested it since I wanted to be picky and go into a specific field. Once I lost financial
      stability due to strong disagreements with the warehouse culture, I figured I'd give it a chance. Little
      did I know, it was exactly what I needed for my next chapter in life. I can finally use my skills
      without being in a good financial spot, and thanks to my aunt's generosity in letting me live in her apartment,
      Chicago has shown me a new outlook on life. I'm currently super excited to see where I'll be after this
      internship is over and to see my social skills and financial stability be at a level I never thought was
      possible for me.
