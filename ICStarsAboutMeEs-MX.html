    <p class="Opening">This is the space I used to practice, got creative, and built my own low effort,
      *about me* from scratch.

    <h2 class="About-Me">About me</h2>
    <img src="img/linkedin.jpg" width="240" height="320" alt="My face">
    <p>My name is Iván Gómez, I was born in the city of Racine, Wisconsin to a Mexican mother from the
      city of León, Guanajuato, and a Chicano (Mexican slang for "Mexican-American") father. I have an
      older brother and two younger sisters, who are more like nieces to me in this point in life, due to
      the age gap of 8 and 15 years. When it was just my brother and I, our family quickly moved down to
      Kenosha and constantly kept moving throughout my younger years. My parent's complicated
      relationship on top of being "unique" in every enviornment I was in played a toll on my social
      interaction, mental health, and self-esteem. Regardless, I had my own ways to get through these
      times, good and bad, but the most important and healthy thing that got me through it were my best
      friends and my deep love for my (mainly nerdy) passions, which most are still are a part of my life
      to this day.
    </p>
    <p>I met my best friends, Casey and Cody Cox *uhuhuhuhuhuh* back in 2009 when we were only 7, and
      we've been through everything since. They ended up moving in 2018 to Surprise, Arizona, a suburb of
      Phoenix, but we still keep in contact almost everyday. We're simliar and different
